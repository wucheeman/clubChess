# Club Chess

## What the project does
This is an full stack MERN application, built as my final project for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the app
You will be able to view the app on Heroku eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This app is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help beyond this README should not be needed, and will not be available.
